We struck the enclosure about the middle of the south side, and almost at the same time, seven mutineers&mdash;Job Anderson, the boatswain, at their head&mdash;appeared in full cry at the southwestern corner.</p><p>They paused as if taken aback, and before they recovered, not only the squire and I, but Hunter and Joyce from the block house, had time to fire. The four shots came in rather a scattering volley, but they did the business: one of the enemy actually fell, and the rest, without hesitation, turned and plunged into the trees.</p><p>After reloading, we walked down the outside of the palisade to see to the fallen enemy. He was stone dead&mdash;shot through the heart.</p></div> </div>
