I have blamed myself enough; my life's forfeit anyway, and I should have been dead by now if Silver hadn't stood for me; and doctor, believe this, I can die&mdash;and I dare say I deserve it&mdash;but what I fear is torture. If they come to torture me&mdash;"</p><p>"Jim," the doctor interrupted, and his voice was quite changed, "Jim, I can't have this. Whip over, and we'll run for it."</p><p>"Doctor," said I, "I passed my word."</p><p>"I know, I know," he cried. "We can't help that, Jim, now. I'll take it on my shoulders, holus bolus, blame and shame, my boy; but stay here, I cannot let you. Jump! One jump, and you're out, and we'll run for it like antelopes."</p></div> </div>
