<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>HIS fifth trip was quite different from any of the others. In the first place, the little gallipot of a boat that we were in was gravely overloaded. Five grown men, and three of them&mdash;Trelawney, Redruth, and the captain&mdash;over six feet high, was already more than she was meant to carry. Add to that the powder, pork, and bread-bags. The gunwale was lipping astern. Several times we shipped a little water, and my breeches and the tails of my coat were all soaking wet before we had gone a hundred yards.</p><p>The captain made us trim the boat, and we got her to lie a little more evenly. All the same, we were afraid to breathe.</p></div> </div>
