<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> For my part, as I was not much use at carrying, I was kept busy all day in the cave packing the minted money into bread-bags.</p><p>It was a strange collection, like Billy Bones's hoard for the diversity of coinage, but so much larger and so much more varied that I think I never had more pleasure than in sorting them. English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Georges, and Louises, doubloons and double guineas and moidores and sequins, the pictures of all the kings of Europe for the last hundred years, strange Oriental pieces stamped with what looked like wisps of string or bits of spider's web, round pieces and square pieces, and pieces bored through the middle, as if to wear them round your neck&mdash;nearly every variety of money in the world must, I think, have found a place in that collection;</p></div> </div>
