All well, I hope; all shipshape and seaworthy?"</p><p>"Well, sir," said the captain, "better speak plain, I believe, even at the risk of offence. I don't like this cruise; I don't like the men; and I don't like my officer. That's short and sweet."</p><p>"Perhaps, sir, you don't like the ship?" inquired the squire, very angry, as I could see.</p></div> </div>
