Just while I was meditating, a puff came, caught the Hispaniola, and forced her up into the current; and to my great joy, I felt the hawser slacken in my grasp, and the hand by which I held it dip for a second under water.</p><p>With that I made my mind up, took out my gully, opened it with my teeth, and cut one strand after another, till the vessel swung only by two.
