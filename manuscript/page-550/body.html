Then I looked around me, and as the ship was now, in a sense, my own, I began to think of clearing it from its last passenger&mdash;the dead man, O'Brien.</p><p>He had pitched, as I have said, against the bulwarks, where he lay like some horrible, ungainly sort of puppet, life-size, indeed, but how different from life's colour or life's comeliness! In that position I could easily have my way with him, and as the habit of tragical adventures had worn off almost all my terror for the dead, I took him by the waist as if he had been a sack of bran and with one good heave, tumbled him overboard.</p></div> </div>
