The isle was uninhabited; my shipmates I had left behind, and nothing lived in front of me but dumb brutes and fowls. I turned hither and thither among the trees. Here and there were flowering plants, unknown to me; here and there I saw snakes, and one raised his head from a ledge of rock and hissed at me with a noise not unlike the spinning of a top. Little did I suppose that he was a deadly enemy and that the noise was the famous rattle.</p><p>Then I came to a long thicket of these oaklike trees&mdash;live, or evergreen, oaks, I heard afterwards they should be called&mdash;which grew low along the sand like brambles, the boughs curiously twisted, the foliage compact, like thatch.</p></div> </div>
