I'll tell you what I think of this: I think it handsome. And if you think as I do, you'll give a good sea-cheer for the gentleman that does it."</p><p>The cheer followed&mdash;that was a matter of course; but it rang out so full and hearty that I confess I could hardly believe these same men were plotting for our blood.</p></div> </div>
