<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"My dear," said my mother suddenly, "take the money and run on. I am going to faint."</p><p>This was certainly the end for both of us, I thought. How I cursed the cowardice of the neighbours; how I blamed my poor mother for her honesty and her greed, for her past foolhardiness and present weakness! We were just at the little bridge, by good fortune; and I helped her, tottering as she was, to the edge of the bank, where, sure enough, she gave a sigh and fell on my shoulder. I do not know how I found the strength to do it at all, and I am afraid it was roughly done, but I managed to drag her down the bank and a little way under the arch. Farther I could not move her, for the bridge was too low to let me do more than crawl below it. So there we had to stay&mdash;my mother almost entirely exposed and both of us within earshot of the inn.</p></div> </div>
