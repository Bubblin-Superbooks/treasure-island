"Nor he weren't, neither&mdash;that's the words. Three years he were the man of this island, light and dark, fair and rain; and sometimes he would maybe think upon a prayer (says you), and sometimes he would maybe think of his old mother, so be as she's alive (you'll say); but the most part of Gunn's time (this is what you'll say)&mdash;the most part of his time was took up with another matter. And then you'll give him a nip, like I do."</p></div> </div>
