<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I had soon told my story and began to look about me. The log-house was made of unsquared trunks of pine&mdash;roof, walls, and floor. The latter stood in several places as much as a foot or a foot and a half above the surface of the sand. There was a porch at the door, and under this porch the little spring welled up into an artificial basin of a rather odd kind&mdash;no other than a great ship's kettle of iron, with the bottom knocked out, and sunk "to her bearings," as the captain said, among the sand.</p><p>Little had been left besides the framework of the house, but in one corner there was a stone slab laid down by way of hearth and an old rusty iron basket to contain the fire.</p></div> </div>
