"I believe not, sir."</p><p>"Next best thing to tell the truth," muttered Captain Smollett. "Load his gun, Hawkins. How many should say there were on your side, doctor?"</p><p>"I know precisely," said Dr. Livesey. "Three shots were fired on this side. I saw the three flashes&mdash;two close together&mdash;one farther to the west."</p><p>"Three!" repeated the captain. "And how many on yours, Mr. Trelawney?"</p><p>But this was not so easily answered. There had come many from the north&mdash;seven by the squire's computation, eight or nine according to Gray. From the east and west only a single shot had been fired. It was plain, therefore, that the attack would be developed from the north and that on the other three sides we were only to be annoyed by a show of hostilities. But Captain Smollett made no change in his arrangements.</p></div> </div>
